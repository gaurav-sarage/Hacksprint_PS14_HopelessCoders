      Wheels R'Us Cycles has a $ 1.2 mn asset base and over 750 people across the globe. Incorporated in 1950, Wheels R'Us Cycles Limited is the largest integrated cycle manufacturer in Maharashtra. The company has a manufacturing capacity of 1k bicycles per year, a highly integrated plant in Ludhiana (Punjab) Ghaziabad (UP), and Bihta (Bihar) and a state of the art manufacturing facility in Sri Lanka as well. In addition to the aforesaid, the group has a Design Centre in the UK and also owns UK-based Avocep Sports, HNF based in Germany. While Avocep Sports was Wheels R'Us Cycles’ first overseas acquisition and marked the company’s entry into the European bicycle market, HNF helped Wheels R'Us foraying into hi-end Electric Bicycles. Acquisition of Firestock Bikes on the other hand was a strategic move to cement its position in the fast-growing premium bicycling segment as a leader in both the standard and premium segments in India, with an overall market share of nearly 40 per cent. The company is equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and the most modern machinery producing major bicycle components within its premise under stringent quality parameters complying with all global standards.
